# better_pynamite

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/powered-by-black-magic.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

Added `better_` because the name `pynamite` was already taken.

## Setup and installation

1. Simply install with

```
pip install better_pynamite
```

2. Import in victim script

```
import better_pynamite
```

3. Let the chaos unfold

## Todo

[for when I/someone else opens this repo again after ages]

[ ] Add a way to configure the probability fo crashing during import. Right now it has been set to `0.5` which is VERY high, especially if you're trying to be sneaky
